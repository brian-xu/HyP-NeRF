This is the official implementation of the paper _"HyP-NeRF: Learning Improved NeRF Priors using a HyperNetwork"_ accepted at **NeurIPS 2023**

## ðŸ‘‰ TODO 
- [ ] Release pretrained checkpoints.
- [ ] Code Release
  - [ ] Training Code
  - [x] Architecture modules, renderer, Meta MRHE
- [ ] ...

## CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT 
Please follow the steps outlined in [torch-ngp](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp#install) repository for creating the environment upto and including the `Build extension` subheading. 

## Acknowledgement

Some parts of the code are inspired and borrowed from [torch-ngp](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp) (which we use as our backbone) and [INR-V](https://github.com/bipashasen/INR-V-VideoGenerationSpace). We thank the authors for providing the source code.
